# 7 Languages

Example files and exercises for Bruce A. Tate's book *Seven Languages in Seven Weeks*.

## Ruby

[Day1](ruby/day1): Basic examples covering the language syntax, Ruby's *duck typing* approach and pattern matching.

[Day2](ruby/day2): Examples for file IO, using advanced data structures, functions and blocks, including a simple version of [grep](ruby/day2/grep.rb). A simple [tree implementation](ruby/day2/tree.rb) illustrates these concepts and explains some of the magic in Ruby.

## Python

Python is not covered by Tate's book. However, I tried to implement some of the examples of the book in Python, just as an exercise and for the fun of it.

[Day2](python/day2): A simple version of [grep](python/day2/grep.py) and a [port of a tree](python/day2/tree.py) data structure in Python using *Iterators*.
